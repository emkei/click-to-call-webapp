A PHP- and jQuery-Mobile-based WebApp that works with Linux and Asterisk to connect two telephone numbers a user entered into a GUI.

The code is part of an article that describes how to develop a PHP-/jQuery/Asterisk/Apache/Linux based Click-to-Call application that calls you back from any website or web application. It also features Raspberry Pi: http://www.kammerath.net/click-to-call.html

Although only in German do not hesitate to contact me if you have any further questions about how this works or want to share information on to do even more.
